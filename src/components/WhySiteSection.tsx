                Therefore ancient texts, written by enlightened sages in a meditative state of mind and studied for thousands of years, are worth studying because they ground the mind and make it conducive for better thinking. This site aims to bring together such pieces of information on yoga by providing links, connecting its various aspects, like asanas and ayurveda and provide a repository of information for the like-minded.

                The yogic texts we know of today are a small fraction of what was available many hundreds of years ago. They were destroyed by invasions and also by insects :). Many yogis gave up their lives trying to preserve them. Some Yogis fled to Tibet, to escape the invaders where the texts and the techniques were preserved in monasteries in the Tibetan language. Others fled to Southern India which was spared a little more from the invasions than was Northern India.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-dharma-stone leading-relaxed">
                While invasions aren't a major cause for concern, and certainly not insects, for preserving these ancient yogic techniques these days, it is dilution and misinterpretation by some teachers, from a sense of ego, that pose problems. My goal is for the website I maintain, to be a place where people can search and get authentic links to the scriptural interpretations as they had been interpreted for thousands of years.
